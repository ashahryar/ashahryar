## ðŸ“˜ About Me
I'm a passionate student aiming to become a skilled **Cloud and Data Engineer**. I have a strong foundation in **Python** and **SQL**, and I'm currently deepening my expertise in **cloud platforms** and **modern data tools**.

Right now, I'm focused on learning how to build **serverless applications**, work with **big data technologies**, and automate **ETL pipelines**. I'm also exploring data orchestration, real-time streaming, and data warehousing.

This profile is my digital notebook where I share what I learn, build mini-projects, and track my progress as I grow. ðŸš€
